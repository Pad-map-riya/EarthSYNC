EarthSYNC

## 💡 Overview
Space & Climate Watch provides a simple, yet powerful solution for understanding complex climate and space data by offering real-time satellite imagery comparisons that make environmental changes visible and understandable and educational storytelling that connects NASA's cosmic discoveries to everyday life on Earth. The platform transforms abstract space data into engaging visual narratives, allowing users to witness environmental transformations through before/after disaster imagery, track live climate indicators, and explore how space technology directly impacts agriculture, weather prediction, and disaster management - making the connection between orbital insights and terrestrial life accessible to everyone.

## ⚙️ Features
1.​Disaster Before/After Slider: An interactive tool to quickly compare pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery.
2.​Location-Based Alerts: Users can input a location to receive alerts about local climate impacts (e.g., drought, flood risk).
3.​Agriculture Dashboard: A dedicated section showing crop health, soil moisture, and growing season data for major regions.
4.​Data Simplicity Score: A feature that rates the severity or trend of a climate metric (e.g., Sea Level: Rising - High).
5.​Mission Explainer Cards: Simple, visual cards explaining the specific NASA satellite collecting the current data (e.g., GPM for rain, MODIS for fires).
6.​"How It Affects You" Section: Direct explanations of how the data impacts daily issues like food prices or insurance costs.
7.​Historical Trend View: The ability to view climate and weather data trends over the last 5, 10, or 20 years for any specific location.
8.​Educational Story Library: A searchable archive of articles, videos, and graphics detailing NASA's Earth science efforts.
9.​Interactive 3D Earth View: A globe visualization tool to explore different climate layers (temperature, carbon, etc.) in real-time.
